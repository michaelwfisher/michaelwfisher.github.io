I am an Assistant Professor in the department of
[Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-
engineering/) at the
[University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/).
A [brief biography](#brief-biography),
my [Curriculum Vitae](cvMWF.pdf) and my profile on
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=rozrGC8AAAAJ&hl=
en&oi=ao).
**I am always looking to hire students with strong mathematical skills and
interest in systems and control.**

## Research Interests

My research interests are centered around dynamics, optimization, and control
of complex, cyber-physical systems.

Recent topics of interest include:

1. [heterogeneous ensemble devices](https://michaelwfisher.github.io/research/#heterogeneous-ensemble-control)
2. [optimal and distributed control](https://michaelwfisher.github.io/research/#optimal-and-distributed-control)
3. [nonlinear and nonsmooth stability analysis](https://michaelwfisher.github.io/research/#nonlinear-and-nonsmooth-stability-analysis)
4. [linear control to improve nonlinear robustness](https://michaelwfisher.github.io/research/#linear-control-to-improve-nonlinear-robustness)

## Brief Biography

Michael W. Fisher joined the University of Waterloo in 2022, where he leads the
Dynamics, Optimization, and Control of Complex Systems (DOCS) Group.
Previously, he was a postdoctoral researcher with the Automatic Control
Laboratory and the Power System Laboratory at ETH Zurich from 2020-2022.
He received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering: Systems at the University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2020, and a M.Sc. in Mathematics from the same
institution in 2017.  He received his B.A. in Mathematics and Physics from
Swarthmore College in 2014.  He was a finalist for the 2017 Conference on
Decision and Control (CDC) Best Student Paper Award and a recipient of the
2019 CDC Outstanding Student Paper Award.
