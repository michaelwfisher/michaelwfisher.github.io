## Complex Systems

![Complex Systems](/figs/complex_systems.png)

Complex systems consist of devices with local dynamics and controllers that
are coupled by physical or cyber networks.
Such systems can exhibit elaborate collective behaviors, and are notoriously
challenging to analyze or control due to their large scale and complexity of
interactions.
Our research is centered around control, optimization, and dynamics of
complex systems, with particular focus in the following areas:

1. [Ensemble Control](#Ensemble-Control)
2. [Optimal and Distributed Control](#Optimal-and-Distributed-Control)
3. [Nonlinear and Nonsmooth Stability Analysis](#Nonlinear-and-Nonsmooth-Stability-Analysis)
4. [Linear Control to Improve Nonlinear Robustness](#Linear-Control-to-Improve-Nonlinear-Robustness)

My research centers around complex systems, which are characterized by local
dynamics coupled over a network, which yields 


all developed for general complex systems, and with application to
power systems.
