## Complex Systems

![Complex Systems](/figs/complex_systems.png)

Complex systems consist of devices with local dynamics and controllers that
are coupled by physical or cyber networks.
Such systems can exhibit elaborate collective behaviors, and are notoriously
challenging to analyze or control due to their large scale and complexity of
interactions.
Our research is centered around control, optimization, and dynamics of
complex systems, with particular focus in the following areas:

1. [Heterogeneous Ensemble Control](#heterogeneous-ensemble-control)
2. [Optimal and Distributed Control](#optimal-and-distributed-control)
3. [Nonlinear and Nonsmooth Stability Analysis](#nonlinear-and-nonsmooth-stability-analysis)
4. [Linear Control to Improve Nonlinear Robustness](#linear-control-to-improve-nonlinear-robustness)

## Heterogeneous Ensemble Control

The goal of this work is to control a collection of heterogeneous
devices so that their aggregate dynamic behavior matches a desired dynamic
behavior as closely as possible, while satisfying local device limitations and
network dependent constraints.
This is a new but challenging problem due to nonconvexity and infinite
dimensionality of the optimization problem required to perform the control
design. Our approach combines a recent optimal control design technique based on
reparameterization with novel finite dimensional function space approximations
to arrive at tractable convex optimization problems for the design.
The methods have been applied to control a dynamic virtual power plant
consisting of a collection of distributed sources of renewable generation.

My research centers around complex systems, which are characterized by local
dynamics coupled over a network, which yields 


all developed for general complex systems, and with application to
power systems.
