Complex systems are made of many parts that interact with each other
to exhibit elaborate collective behaviors. Due to the large scale and
intricacy of their interconnection, as well as their susceptibility
to nonlocal and nonlinear disturbances, stability assessment and
control design for such systems are notoriously difficult.

My research centers around complex systems, which are characterized by local
dynamics coupled over a network, which yields 


all developed for general complex systems, and with application to
power systems.

1. optimal, distributed, and constrained ensemble control of future power
systems
2. vulnerability assessment to nonsmooth disturbances in networked systems
3. control design for improving nonlinear robustness in complex systems
