# Research Interests

My research interests are centered around dynamics, optimization, and control
of complex, cyber-physical systems.

Recent topics of interest include:

1. ensemble control of distributed resources
2. optimal and constrained control
3. nonlinear and nonsmooth stability analysis
4. linear control to improve nonlinear robustness
